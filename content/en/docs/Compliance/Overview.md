Many organizations must comply rules from government, industry consortiums, and other organizations, and often some rules exist regarding the protection of sensitive data.

In addition, many businesses elect to adopt a set of rules to follow to protect sensitive data, and these rules are often monitored by internal audit deparments.

Some of the most well-know sets of compliance rules are:
* SOX
* PII DSS
* HIPAA
* GDPR
* FISMA/NIST: https://ncp.nist.gov/checklist/838
* GLBA
* ISO/IEC 27001
