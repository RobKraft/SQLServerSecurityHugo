###### Defense in Depth

Defense-in-Depth is a security strategy of implementing many layers of security instead of relying on a single security measure for protection.  Implementing multiple safeguards deters attackers that overcome one only to be confronted by another.  They are known to slow down some automated attacks that aren't prepared for them.  They also slow down attackers and this provides more time for the attacker's activities to be noticed and action taken to stop them.
