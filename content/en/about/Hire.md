I live in the Kansas City metro area and would love to meet with you in person.  I am also happy to work with your team remotely.

My specialties are:

* .Net development
* Architecting solutions
* SQL Server
* Securing applications

I offer the following:

* I am happy to spend an hour with you at no charge to learn about your challenges and provide ideas and discover what if I can offer help.
* I particularly enjoy helping non-profits pro-bono or at low reasonable rates on larger projects.
* I offer a "second opinion" on architectures.  If you are considering starting a new solution and want to bounce your plans and ideas off the mind of another architect, please reach out.
* I can mentor and train your developers to write better code.  Code that is CLEAN, SOLID, and easy to maintain.
* I can help your team get rid of SQL Injection bugs in your code base, especially in .Net code bases, no matter how many thousands of SQL Statements you need to protect.
* I can help your team adopt some practices to improve speed of delivery and quality.  Those practices include automated builds, unit tests, automated deployments, and task tracking tools.
* I can crank out .Net code and/or SQL to solve problems.

Some of stuff I am good include:

* Solving problems
* Abstracting solutions to create good coding patterns that are easy to maintain and that minimize bugs
* Software Architecture
* Leading teams of technical people
* Software Development Practices and Methodologies:
  * Agile
  * Kanban
  * Scrum
* C# .Net, VB .Net
* SQL
* SQL Server
* Visual Basic 6
* Office Automation (Excel, Outlook, etc.)
* Microsoft Access (especially with SQL Server Back Ends)
* Azure
* AWS
* HTML, Javascript, CSS
* Silverlight, CSLA
