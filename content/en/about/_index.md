My name is Rob Kraft.

* I've been writing SQL since the early 90's.
* I started a role as a SQL Server DBA in the early 90's on SQL Server Version 4.2.1.
* I was a Microsoft Certified Solution Developer (MCSD)
* I taught Microsoft Certified courses on SQL Server
* I co-authored some books on SQL Server decades ago.
  * [Practical Microsoft SQL Server 7](https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Microsoft-SQL-Server/dp/0789721473/)
  * [Hardening Network Security](https://www.amazon.com/Hardening-Network-Security-John-Mallery/dp/0072257032/)
* I created a free, simple backup product for SQL Server Express [Simple SQL](https://simplesql.net/), but I now recommend [SQL Backup Master](https://www.sqlbackupmaster.com/) instead of the program I wrote.
* I have given a lot of presentations on SQL Injection, mostly at SQL Saturday events.
* I serve as a volunteer for the [Center for Internet Security](https://www.cisecurity.org/) providing guidance regarding securing SQL Server.

Despite all the SQL Server stuff, my primary role has been application developer and solution architect.  Mostly on the Microsoft stacks like .Net.

* I am an expert and architecting, designing, and writing secure SQL in applications that communicate with SQL Servers.
* I have a few github repos to help you write secure code:
  * [SQL Injection Detection](https://github.com/RobKraft/SQLInjectionDetection)
  * [SQL Server Login Template](https://github.com/RobKraft/SQLServerLoginTemplate)
  * SQL Server Code Builders - hmm - guess I need to make this public soon
